Subject: Cooperation Between Python and Javascript

The JavaScript folks on the team don't think the Python developers
can keep up with all their "super awesome javascript codez." In the
interest of keeping both the front and backend devs working together,
we're sending out a test of sorts to see if you each can comprehend 
and modify the code the other writes.

Included is an index.html file as well as a couple of images that go
along with the JavaScript test. Look the test over and complete the
three tasks included on the page.

To view the test, load up the page in your favorite browser.

Thanks again!
